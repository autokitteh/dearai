# What is AutoKitteh?

AutoKitteh is an open-source workflow automation and orchestration platform
tailored for developers. It enables the creation, management, and monitoring
of code-centric automations and durable workflows.

It is a developer-first alternative to no-code/low-code platforms (such as
Zapier, Workato, Make.com, etc.), as well as a durable execution platform
which is a complement to [Temporal](https://temporal.io).

It offers tools and simplified abstractions for crafting reliable,
long-running workflows without sacrificing the power and flexibility of
sophisticated code.

## Who Can Benefit From AutoKitteh

AutoKitteh is designed for users ranging from the very sophisticated to the
less technical skilled enthusiast. Typical use cases include:

- **DevOps engineers:** Whether you're setting up CI/CD pipelines, managing cloud resources, or building orchestration workflows, AutoKitteh streamlines your processes and deploys them in a highly reliable manner. AutoKitteh lets you quickly connect to cloud service providers (e.g., AWS, Google, Azure), code repositories (e.g., GitHub, Gitlab), and other popular tools such as Slack, Jira, etc.

- **Backend developers:** For long-running, reliable workflows that link microservices and external APIs, AutoKitteh offers a simplified alternative to platforms such as Temporal, Cadence, Prefect, AWS Step Functions, or Airflow.

<!-- - **Automation engineers and enthusiasts:** If you're seeking an alternative to platforms like Zapier, Make.com, or Workato, AutoKitteh's code-centric approach empowers you to build and manage customized, complex, and long-running automation solutions.

- **Automation engineers and enthusiasts:** AutoKitteh is for you if you're into building and managing automations but need more control than what other platforms offer (like Zapier, Make.com, or Workato). AutoKittehâ€™s simple-yet-powerful tools allow you to build and manage workflows ranging from basic to super sophisticated.

:::note

AutoKitteh is more of an orchestration platform for any type of pipeline. It
is less suitable for the actual processing in ETL and big data pipelines.
