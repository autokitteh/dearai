# Initialize a Connection

To use our Asana integration, you'll need to set up a connection by obtaining a Personal Access Token (PAT). This token will allow you to authenticate with the Asana API.

### Prerequisites

1. **Asana Account:** Make sure you have an active Asana account.
2. **Personal Access Token (PAT):** Follow [Asana’s guide](https://developers.asana.com/docs/quick-start#get-a-personal-access-token) to generate your PAT.

Once you have your PAT, you’ll be ready to connect and start using the Asana API with our integration.
