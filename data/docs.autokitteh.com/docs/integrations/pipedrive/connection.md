# Initialize a Connection

To use the Pipedrive integration, you'll need to set up a connection by providing two pieces of information:

1. **API Key**: Your Pipedrive API token for authentication
2. **Company Domain**: Your Pipedrive company domain

## Prerequisites

- An active Pipedrive account
- Access to your Pipedrive API settings

## Getting Your API Key

[Pipedrive's API documentation](https://support.pipedrive.com/en/article/how-can-i-find-my-personal-api-key).

## Getting Your Company Domain

Your company domain is the full URL you use to access Pipedrive, including `https://` and `.pipedrive.com`.

For example: `https://autokitteh-domain.pipedrive.com`
