# Initialize a Connection

To use our Anthropic integration, you'll need to set up a connection by using an API key. This will allow you to authenticate with the Anthropic API.

### Prerequisites

1. **Anthropic Account:** Make sure you have an Anthropic account.
2. **API key:** Get your Admin API key through the [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/dashboard).
