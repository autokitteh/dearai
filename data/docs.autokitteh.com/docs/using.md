# Using AutoKitteh

There are two options to use an AutoKitteh server:

- Self-hosted installation of our open-source server: on your PC, a VM, or a
  container - [follow this guide](/get_started/quickstart)
- AutoKitteh Cloud (currently in beta): fill
  [this form](https://autokitteh.com/get-a-demo) to get a demo, or contact us
  at meow@autokitteh.com

There are two User Interface options to interact with the server:
