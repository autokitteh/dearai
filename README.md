# Dear AI

Add the `dearai` folder or `dearai.txt` to your favorite LLM to learn how to use AutoKitteh.

**IMPORTANT**: The `data` and `dearai` directories, and the `dearai.txt` file are autogenerated, do not directly modify them.

## How this works

```
$ make
```

Will remove and recreate `dearai/` from files in `src/`. Each file in `src/` runs through `jinja2`.
All files that start with `_` are not processed, but can be used as inputs to other files, for example via `{% include ... %}` directives.

## DEPENDENCIES
