# DearAI - AutoKitteh AI Instructions

This repository contains tools and data for training and running an AI assistant that helps users with AutoKitteh integration development.

## Usage

```
$ make
```

This produces the `data`, `dearai`, and `digests` directories.

## Directory Structure

### `dearai/`

This directory is generated by running `make dearai`.

The processed and cleaned dataset ready for AI training/inference:

- **`integrations/`** - Processed integration documentation (Markdown files)
- **`kittehub/`** - Cleaned integration examples with metadata only
- **`pyak/`** - AutoKitteh Python SDK with function bodies abbreviated to `...`
- Other processed documentation files

This directory contains:

- Abbreviated AutoKitteh Python SDK code (function signatures with `...` bodies)
- Integration metadata extracted from the `data` directory
- Cleaned documentation optimized for AI consumption

### `digests/`

This directory is generated by running `make digests`.

Contains various combinations of the `dearai/` directory in single files for easily including in chatbots.

### `data/`

This directory is populated by running `make data`.

Contains raw source data downloaded from AutoKitteh repositories:

- **`kittehub-main/`** - Downloaded integration examples and templates from the KitteHub repository
- **`autokitteh-main/`** - Core AutoKitteh codebase and Python SDK
- **`docs.autokitteh.com/`** - Official AutoKitteh documentation
- **`integrations.txt`** - List of allowed integrations extracted from metadata
- **`requirements.txt`** - Python dependencies for the SDK

### `src/`

Contains source templates and configuration files used to generate the final `dearai/` dataset:

- **Template files** - Jinja2 templates that are processed to generate documentation and configuration files
- **`pyak/`** - Source version of the AutoKitteh Python SDK before abbreviation processing
- **Integration templates** - Source templates for integration documentation that get processed into the final format

Files in this directory are processed by `uvx jinja2` during the build process (excluding files starting with `_` or in `_*` directories) to generate the corresponding files in `dearai/`. This allows for dynamic content generation and templating of the final AI training dataset.

The `src/` directory serves as the source of truth for content that needs to be templated or processed before being included in the final `dearai/` output.
