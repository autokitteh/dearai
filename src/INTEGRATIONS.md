The following integration names are supported:
{% include "_data/integrations.txt" %}

These are the ONLY integrations supported.
NEVER specifiy any integration that does not appear above as an integration.

Check \_EVENTS.md before using `event_type` - many integrations (auth0, aws, notion, googlesheets, etc.) are API-only and do NOT support events.
