# Discord Events

[![Start with AutoKitteh](https://autokitteh.com/assets/autokitteh-badge.svg)](https://app.autokitteh.cloud/template?name=samples/discord/events)

This project demonstrates how to utilize AutoKitteh's event system for Discord, offering a simpler alternative to the [discord.py library](../discord_client/) when working with supported [events](https://docs.autokitteh.com/integrations/discord/events). The program listens for message-related events (message creation, update, and deletion) in Discord and logs the corresponding information. This example serves as a foundational guide for integrating AutoKitteh's Discord event handling with other services.

## Benefits

- **Simple Integration:** This workflow is designed to easily connect Discord to custom logging or processing systems.
- **Modular Design:** You can extend or modify this program to suit your specific needs, such as adding more event types or integrating with external APIs.
