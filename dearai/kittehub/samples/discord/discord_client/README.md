[![Start with AutoKitteh](https://autokitteh.com/assets/autokitteh-badge.svg)](https://app.autokitteh.cloud/template?name=samples/discord/discord_client)

This project demonstrates how to use AutoKitteh's Discord integration to create a basic Discord bot that performs simple operations. The bot connects to Discord, waits until it is ready, and then sends a "Meow!" message to a specified channel. This example serves as a foundational guide for integrating AutoKitteh's Discord capabilities into your own projects.

## Benefits

- **Simple Integration:** Quickly set up a Discord bot using AutoKitteh's Discord integration.
- **Event Handling:** Listens for the `on_ready` event and can be extended to handle more events.
