## How It Works

1. Receive a help request from a user
2. Identify the request topic using Gemini AI
3. Assign the request to the appropriate expert based on the expertise table
4. Confirm the expertâ€™s acceptance of the request
5. Track the request until the expert resolves it
6. Remind the expert if the request remains unresolved within a set time

## Cloud Usage

1. Initialize your connections (Google Sheets, Google Gemini, Slack)
2. Set the `DIRECTORY_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID` project variable, in the "VARIABLES" tab, to point to your Google Sheet
3. (Optional) Set the `HELP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MINUTES` project variable, in the "VARIABLES" tab, to set the timeout for unclaimed requests
4. Deploy project

## Trigger Workflow

The workflow is triggered when the bot is mentioned in a message within a channel where it is a member. For example:

```
@autokitteh help me with my cat
```

When a topic matches an expert's expertise, the bot notifies them. The expert can use:

- `!take` to claim the request
- `!resolve` to mark it complete

## Self-Hosted Deployment
