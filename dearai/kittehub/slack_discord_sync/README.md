[![Start with AutoKitteh](https://autokitteh.com/assets/autokitteh-badge.svg)](https://app.autokitteh.cloud/template?name=slack_discord_sync)

This project automates the process of mirroring messages between Slack and Discord channels. It listens for new message events in Discord or Slack and sends them to the corresponding channel on the other platform. This project is intended as a starting point rather than a complete solution.

## Benefits

- **Cross-Platform Communication:** Automatically mirrors messages between Discord and Slack, keeping teams connected across both platforms.
- **Ease of Use:** Demonstrates how to easily integrate AutoKitteh with Slack and Discord APIs.
