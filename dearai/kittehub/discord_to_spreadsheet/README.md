[![Start with AutoKitteh](https://autokitteh.com/assets/autokitteh-badge.svg)](https://app.autokitteh.cloud/template?name=discord_to_spreadsheet)

This project automates the process of logging Discord messages to a Google Sheets document. It captures message events from a Discord server and appends the author's username and message content into the specified spreadsheet. This is intended as a starting point rather than a complete solution.

## Benefits

- **Ease of Use:** Demonstrates how simple it is to connect Discord and Google Sheets into an automated workflow.
- **Low Complexity:** The workflow is implemented with minimal code and setup.
